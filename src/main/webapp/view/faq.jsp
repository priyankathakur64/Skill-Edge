<b>How long do I get to complete my course?</b>
<br><br>
-> With Skill Edge, there is no time limit on any of our distance learning courses. Whether you choose to take weeks, months, or even years, the course would not expire.
<br><br>
<b>How long should it take me to finish the course?</b>
<br><br>
-> Each course does vary, as do individuals, but on average our courses take from 120-200 hours. We design our courses to be taken at your own pace. Whether you want to add to your skills in a hurry, or take your time and really immerse yourself in the material, the choice is yours.
<br><br>
<b>Can I get a hard copy of the study materials?</b>
<br><br>
-> Yes. If you prefer to have a hard copy, there is an additional 50.Rs fee to send a hard copy to you in the post. You can request this upon checkout when paying for the course.
<br>
<br>
<b>What support will I receive?</b>
<br><br>
-> For courses you can count on the ongoing support and encouragement of our tutoring team who are available by both email and phone. All enquiries are responded to within 1-5 working days. There is no support provided with eBooks.
<br>
<br>
<b>I have not received my course details?</b>
<br><br>
-> If you have purchased your course, or eBook, and have not received the necessary files we advise you to check your email and your junk/spam filter. The files are automatically sent to customers on completion of checkout, and some overzealous spam filters can flag the emails thinking they are spam.
<br>
<br>
<b>My link has expired</b>
<br><br>
-> The download links only last for 48hrs so they can not be shared online. If you have made a purchase, please contact us and we will reset a new download link for you.
